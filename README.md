# bajaj-health-bill-extraction
This project implements an automated invoice/bill data extraction system that reads multi-page documents, identifies all line items, and extracts item name, quantity, rate, and net amount with high accuracy. It also detects sub-totals (when present), extracts the final bill total, and ensures no items are double-counted or missed.
